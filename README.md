# Stellar Structure

A simple yet powerful tool for solving numerically, the fundamental equations of stellar structure. It uses the Runge-Kutta fourth order method (commonly known as RK4) to express the mass, density and pressure as a function of the star's radius.

Throughout this program the following assumptions were made
* Spherical symmetry
* The stars is isolated in space
* The star is in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium

## How to compile

First change to the directory 

then run

```
makefile 
```


To use the program run

```
./stellarStructure 
```

## Output

The program generates three ".dat" files. You can see a plot of a typical output [here] (https://www.dropbox.com/s/69w10ssrumwlnhx/typicalOutput.pdf?dl=0).
